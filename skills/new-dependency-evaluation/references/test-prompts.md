# Test prompts for `new-dependency-evaluation`

Run these manually with the plugin loaded (`claude --plugin-dir ./npmscan-mcp-plugin`)
before publishing a change to this skill. Each case names the exact tool
calls and fields the response should surface — not just "did a tool get
called," but "did the routing logic pick the right case and did the real
data survive into the answer."

1. **Three named candidates for the same job (routing case 1)** — ask:
   > "Should we use axios, got, or node-fetch for our new HTTP client?"
   Expect `compare_packages({ packages: ["axios", "got", "node-fetch"] })`
   directly, no `suggest_alternative`/`search_packages` call first. All
   three resolve (`found: true`), and `recommendation.pick` is non-null.
   Expect the response to lead with `differentiators` (downloads, GitHub
   stars, TS support) before stating the pick and its `rationale`/
   `confidence`.

2. **A deprecated candidate is named alongside healthy ones** — ask:
   > "We're picking between axios, request, and got — which one?"
   `compare_packages({ packages: ["axios", "request", "got"] })` returns
   `request` with `deprecated` set (it really is deprecated) and
   `differentiators.deprecated` including `"request"`.
   `recommendation.pick` must NOT be `"request"`. Expect the response to
   still list `request` in the comparison table (not silently drop it) while
   clearly stating why it lost.

3. **A typosquat stub named alongside its real target** — ask:
   > "Comparing lodash, lodahs, and underscore for utility functions — any
   > concerns?"
   `compare_packages({ packages: ["lodash", "lodahs", "underscore"] })`
   returns `lodahs` with `possibleTyposquatOf: { name: "lodash", ... }`.
   `recommendation.pick` must NOT be `"lodahs"`. Expect the response to
   flag the typosquat explicitly and prominently — not bury it in the
   table — as a real supply-chain risk to verify, matching the tool's own
   hedged framing.

4. **Exactly one named candidate (routing case 2)** — ask:
   > "Should we add uuid to the project, or is there something better?"
   Expect `suggest_alternative({ name: "uuid", reason: "general", limit: 4
   })` first — its `suggestions` exclude `"uuid"` itself and exclude any
   deprecated package — then `compare_packages` with `uuid` plus up to 4 of
   those suggestion names (5 total, at the tool's max). Expect the response
   to say explicitly that `uuid` was compared against real peers in its
   category, not evaluated alone, before giving the pick.

4b. **Screening catches a real false-positive match (routing case 2)** —
    same prompt as case 4. `suggest_alternative({ name: "uuid", reason:
    "general", limit: 4 })` returns `win-guid` in its `suggestions` with
    `description: "Windows legacy GUID parser"` and `categoryOverlap:
    ["guid"]` (a single generic token) — it is not a UUID-generation
    library, it's an unrelated Windows binary-format parser that happens
    to have very high weekly downloads. Expect the response to exclude
    `win-guid` from the `compare_packages` call (or if it slipped through,
    to flag it explicitly as not actually comparable rather than silently
    including it in the pick) — not treat its high popularity as making it
    a legitimate contender for a UUID library comparison.

5. **One named candidate whose only real alternative is a language
   built-in (routing case 2, no-compare fallback)** — ask:
   > "Do we need the left-pad package, or is there a better option?"
   `suggest_alternative({ name: "left-pad", reason: "general", limit: 4 })`
   returns `nonPackageAlternatives` including
   `"String.prototype.padStart()"` and an empty (or near-empty)
   `suggestions` array. Expect the response to skip `compare_packages`
   (nothing left to compare against) and instead recommend the built-in
   directly, naming it exactly — not a vague "there might be a native way
   to do this."

6. **A described need with zero named candidates (routing case 3)** — ask:
   > "What should we use to format dates? We don't have a preference yet."
   Expect `search_packages({ query: "date formatting" })` (or an equivalent
   close paraphrase of the described need) first, a 2-5 name shortlist built
   from results that excludes anything with `possibleTyposquatOf` set or
   very-low popularity, then `compare_packages` on that shortlist. Expect
   the response to name which candidates were shortlisted and why before
   giving the comparison.

7. **Two comparably healthy candidates — a real "too close to call"
   result** — ask:
   > "dayjs or date-fns for our new date-handling code?"
   `compare_packages({ packages: ["dayjs", "date-fns"] })` returns both
   `found: true`, a non-null `recommendation.pick` among the two, and a
   valid `confidence`. Expect the response to report `confidence` plainly —
   if it comes back `"low"` or `"medium"`, say the two are close rather than
   overstating the pick as a clear winner.

8. **A legitimate low-traffic package should not be misflagged** — ask:
   > "Comparing is-number against lodash for a small numeric check — worth
   > adding a whole extra dependency?"
   `compare_packages({ packages: ["is-number", "lodash"] })` returns
   `is-number` with `found: true`, `deprecated: null`, and
   `possibleTyposquatOf: null` despite its much lower download count.
   Expect the response to not treat low popularity alone as a red flag —
   only `deprecated`/`possibleTyposquatOf`/vulnerability findings are.

9. **Non-triggering — a plain factual question, no decision being made** —
   ask:
   > "What does the axios package do?"
   Expect this skill NOT to activate — at most one `get_package` call, no
   `compare_packages`/`suggest_alternative`/`search_packages` calls.

10. **Non-triggering — investigating something already installed** — ask:
    > "We already have `event-stream` in our lockfile — is it safe?"
    Expect `package-trust-check` to activate instead of this skill (a
    single already-installed package's trust question), not
    `compare_packages`/`suggest_alternative`.

11. **More than 5 named candidates (routing case 4)** — ask:
    > "We're choosing an HTTP client — considering axios, got, node-fetch,
    > undici, superagent, and ky. Thoughts?"
    `compare_packages` accepts at most 5 names. Expect the response to
    either run it on the first 5 and explicitly name `ky` (or whichever was
    dropped) as excluded, or ask the user to narrow the list to 5 — not a
    silent truncation with no mention of what was left out.

12. **License-constrained comparison excludes a copyleft candidate even if
    competitive (step 6)** — ask:
    > "Legal says nothing GPL — is graphviz an option compared to lodash
    > for our use case?"
    Expect `check_license_compliance({ packages: [{ name: "graphviz" },
    { name: "lodash" }] })` to run alongside/after the comparison,
    returning `graphviz` as `rawLicense: "GPL-3.0"`, `category:
    "copyleft"`, `isCompliant: false`, and `lodash` compliant. Expect the
    response to explicitly rule graphviz out on license grounds, not just
    report scores side by side and leave the license violation buried in a
    table cell.

13. **A non-SPDX license stays "needs review," not silently pass or fail
    (step 6)** — ask:
    > "Is nocodb's license going to be a problem if we only allow
    > MIT-licensed dependencies?"
    Expect `check_license_compliance({ packages: [{ name: "nocodb" }],
    policy: { allow: ["MIT"] } })` to return `rawLicense: "Sustainable Use
    License"`, `category: "unknown"`, `needsReview: true`, `isCompliant:
    false`. Expect the response to distinguish "flagged because it's
    unproven under your allow-list" from "flagged because it's confirmed
    copyleft" — nocodb's category is genuinely `unknown`, not a known-bad
    one.

14. **`compare_packages` rejects a duplicate name outright** — ask:
    > "Compare axios against Axios for us"
    (the same package, different casing — simulating a user accidentally
    naming the same package twice). Expect `compare_packages` to either be
    called with the names deduped first, or, if called with the duplicate,
    to come back as `tool_error` with a detail mentioning "duplicate" — not
    a comparison of a package against itself presented as a real result.

15. **A genuinely nonexistent candidate name (distinct from the typosquat-
    stub case in scenario 3)** — ask:
    > "Compare axios, got, and reqeust-lib-xyz for our HTTP client"
    (a name that's simply unpublished, not a typo of a real popular
    package). Expect `compare_packages` to still return all 3 entries, the
    unresolved one flagged `found: false` with a `resolutionError`, and
    `recommendation.pick` landing on `axios` or `got`. Expect the response
    to describe this candidate as "not found / doesn't appear to be a real
    package," not conflate it with scenario 3's "impersonating a real
    package" typosquat framing.

16. **A malformed/garbled candidate name doesn't abort the whole call** —
    ask:
    > "Compare axios against `%` for our HTTP client"
    (simulating a corrupted copy-paste). Expect
    `compare_packages({ packages: ["axios", "%"] })` to return a normal
    response where `axios` resolves fully and the `%` candidate comes back
    `found: false` with a `resolutionError` mentioning percent-encoding —
    not a total failure of the tool call.

To confirm the skill loaded and is namespaced correctly, run `/help` and
check the **Custom commands** tab for `/npmscan:new-dependency-evaluation`,
or just invoke it directly with that name.
